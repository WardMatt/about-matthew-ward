            I have a few hobbies. I enjoy board games, but during pandemic times this has become difficult. Staying at home has been daunting,
            so I have started a new hobby Mountain Bike Riding. It gets me out of the house and exploring different parts of Albuquerque and New Mexico.
            It improves my health and reduces my stress. <br>

            Other things interesting things about me:

            <li>We have 2 dogs, a cat, and 2 fish living in our house.</li>
            <li>I have a daughter who is the light of my life, when she gets enough sleep.</li>
            <li>When things get difficult I try to remember it can always get worse.</li>
            <li>I was born a long time ago.</li>
